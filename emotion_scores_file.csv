If you permit me to give some of my time to the relief committee I will be very glad to.” So I went there and like any other committee there were people who belonged to different groups and they were trying to pull things toward their side.  I am a man who has no prejudice against anybody.  I want to do the work that is entrusted to me with fairness to all concerned.  So we had the committee and added new members and they elected me the President of the committee.  And we worked very hard for four years to administer the relief.

At the time Mr. Mihran Karagheusian was the treasurer of AGBU.  This is an organization which has an important amount of capital.

One of the members, when he heard from me and the type of work we were doing, which I called exemplary [illustrative], they told us that we were doing such good work, fundamental work, that it can be done by other communities.  I was saying that one of the members said if you are doing so much work, why don’t we advertise and tell the people what we are doing? Maybe then more people will contribute. Miss Karagheusian did no agree with that. She said that we would have to answer lots of letters; thus we don’t want any contributions.  There is a fund which is specifically for our work and we do our big work according to our income.

Ezchmiadzin,Armenia,40.16203197,44.29081976,,1983,"       After that the Armenian Church was divided into two: one Tashnag and the other Henchag.  One supporting Soviet Armenia, the other detached from Soviet Armenia.  There was a great fight about whom to elect. The Catholicos of Armenia came from Echmiadzin to elect the Catholicos, but it was quite evident that he wasn’t free.  He was always being helped in whatever he said.  Then they began to have discussions.  Mr. Hagop Der Melkonian, who was the head of the Tachnag Party (Tashnagtstiun) at the time, said the oracle??? for us but we have come here to do some work.  At least let us appoint a committee to arrange the procedures. That was stopped.  Melkonian said: “let’s have an election and finish with it.”


        Another man prominent among the Armenians, is Mr. Vahe Sethian.  He said, “why have we come here today, to make a declamation??? A contest in declamation or to elect a Catholicos?” So despite the Catholicos from Echmiadzin, they got on with the procedure. That day it [the election] was postponed.  The next day the man that came from Echmiadzin went without doing [voting], but in his absence, I believe so but I don’t know the details, Catholicos Ardavast Surmelian was elected.  This Catholicos was very unfortunate in his period of office.  The people were divided, one for him, another party against him.  He was a fine man, but he died from coronary thrombosis. Then they elected his contemporary, Catholicos Khoren.  I know the time that he was elected and the period of his anointment.  This required  five bishops, however, there were only four, so they got one bishop from the Syrian Church.  Poor fellow [Khoren], he was on his knees, tears in his eyes, how am I going to carry on with this responsibility!  But he proved to be a very able man, a very able man.  He carried on: he built a new Catholicosate.  He built schools, he, through the help of Leila Karagheusian, built an Armenian Community home called Leila Van which has 400 families [where is this???] But two years ago he (Khoren) had heart disease and suffered.  He went to hospital several times; he went to London to be operated on.  They said he was too sick to be operated on.  So he did something very nice.  He said I am a sick man.  I would like the Nation to elect a man together with me so that when I pass from the picture the other man will carry on.  So we have now this Catholicos Karekin II Sarkissian. Karekin was co-Catholicos, Atoragits (chair sharer).

Kilis,Turkey,36.71538487,37.11937674,April,1858,"        Hagop (Agop) Agha went to Kilis, while his family continued to live in Istanbul.  In Kilis, Hagop (Agop) Agha built a soap making factory (masmanah).  It had several vats each capable of making 16,000 batmans of soap at a time (1 batman = 3Kgs). The soap was shipped to many places and as far away as Baghdad.  Hagop (Agop) Agha had two partners in Kilis (I believe one was Muslim, maybe both were, names ??). He was very much liked by the people in Kilis. Around 1858 he sent after his family and they came to live with him in Kilis.  Aghek Agha was born in 1860 after the family was reunited in Kilis.  His baptismal name was Stephan, but was known as Aghek Agha, the good Agha.  There is a difference of about twenty years between Aghek Agha and his older siblings.  As to the siblings, Tavit Agha , the oldest, married in Kilis and had four sons.  The oldest son (Aghavni’s father) managed a village (tell Hussein) in the vilayet.  The other three (two of whom Krikor and Mihran were graduates of Aintab College) were killed by the Turks in the war of 1895 by order of the Sultan. Tavit Agha’s home was ransacked.  Tavit Agha himself was sent to prison and spent a year there under the false accusation that his sons had fought against the Turks in the war of Zeytoun (date?).  The eldest son, who managed a village (tell Hussein) escaped disguised as a woman.  It is said that Tavit Agha never really recovered from this tragic loss of his three sons.  He did marry again (how did his first wife die?), late in life, his second wife was Gullu (aka Nene), digin Endza’s [Endsa Yeni Komshian Zenian] mother.


        Aghek Agha’s other brother, Hampartzoum Agha, had two sons, Sarkis (also known as Sarkis Khodja.  He was named after the Amira’s son Sarkis who had died as a young bachelor) and Vahan (who became a priest).     Information concerning Aghek Agha’s older sisters, Varo and Sultan, is scant. Varo married Ghazar Agha Basmadjian, she had a son who was killed on April 24, 1915.  Sultan married Hagop Attarian (Aboj) [ Sultan is Siradzin’s grandmother, Siradzin is wife of Mihran Yeni Komshian]
        Aghek Agha was 16 when his father, Hagop (Agop) Agha, died suddenly. His father, who had lived in Kilis for the last 20 years of his life, had made an excellent name and reputation for himself there and Aghek inherited a lot of good will. Aghek Agha was also liked for his own self.  In 1881 he married Louisa, the daughter of (first name?) Ter Kevorkian of Aleppo. Their first son, Hagop Ami, was their only child.  She died soon after his birth because, it is said, she was terrified by Turkish soldiers who raided their home looking for contraband tobacco. Aghek Agha remained a widower for four years.  He then married Maria Seropian (our Nene).  He (Aghek Agha) died in Beirut in 1928.

At the time, my father was the head of the Armenian National Union, that goes but at the time the most important part of his activities was to try to estimate what would the losses of the Armenians that were deported and who was going to compensate them.  Because at the end of the first world war in 1918 Armenians were allowed to go back to their homes in Turkey.  The Armenians returned to their homes with great expectations that the wrongs would be righted.  Unfortunately, my father was so disappointed, there was a double occupation army in Kilis, French and English.

After Sahag Catholicos died we had Bedros Sarajian Catholicos who was an old man to begin with.  One day I remembered he made a special mass for the Allied armies, especially for France and the French Consul was there and one week after that he died.
After Sarajian we had a very learned man from Armenia, but at the time he was bishop of North America.  His name was Catholicos Karekin I Hovsepian.
At the time I was the head of the Armenian Central Committee and there were two candidates: one was Karekin Khachadourian of Brazil and the other Karekin Hovsepian of New York.  Everybody’s opinion was the Karekin Hovsepian was the worthier of the two.  He was a prominent scholar.  In fact on his way from Armenia to America he had given a lecture, at West Hall [of the American University of Beirut], on Armenian Church art.  We had met him. I said at that meeting that if you think he is the man, then invite him, but first elect him unanimously.  They said he is getting rather old but we managed to get a unanimous vote for him.  In fact I said something on that occasion.  If somebody comes from Baghdad with my name written [on a piece of paperit] ???and it was Doctor Yeni Komshian, I’ll do whatever I can for him wholeheartedly.  If he comes to me and begins to ask which doctor to go to, in this doctor better than the other one, I would say go to anyone that you like.  If you elect him unanimously, he will come.  And of course he was elected unanimously and he came and before coming he said give me six months to arrange my things and get a little fund so that I can be useful.  I am old but if that is the wish of the Ask [the nation] I will comply.


        One of the happiest days of my life was when we went to Sidon to meet him; he was coming through Jerusalem.  Mr. Henry Pharaoun lent, for the special occasion, his Roles Royce car, and a big group brought him to the church at Antilias; and the minute [he arrived] all the bells rang in the Antilias church, and ourakh ler yegeghetso (an Armenian hymn meaning Happy Hills and a word derived from the word for church = yegeghetsi) was played or sung. Oh it was a [great feeling???].  He conducted service.


        He worked as Catholicos for five years and his days finished."," oh yes, that was one happy day.  shushan asked me if i had anything to do in electing a catholicos.  yes, i was an active elector of catholicoses.  after sahag catholicos died we had bedros sarajian catholicos who was an old man to begin with.  one day i remembered he made a special mass for the allied armies, especially for france and the french consul was there and one week after that he died.
after sarajian we had a very learned man from armenia, but at the time he was bishop of north america.  his name was catholicos karekin i hovsepian.
at the time i was the head of the armenian central committee and there were two candidates: one was karekin khachadourian of brazil and the other karekin hovsepian of new york.  everybody’s opinion was the karekin hovsepian was the worthier of the two.  he was a prominent scholar.  in fact on his way from armenia to america he had given a lecture, at west hall [of the american university of beirut], on armenian church art.  we had met him. i said at that meeting that if you think he is the man, then invite him, but first elect him unanimously.  they said he is getting rather old but we managed to get a unanimous vote for him.  in fact i said something on that occasion.  if somebody comes from baghdad with my name written [on a piece of paperit] ???and it was doctor yeni komshian, i’ll do whatever i can for him wholeheartedly.  if he comes to me and begins to ask which doctor to go to, in this doctor better than the other one, i would say go to anyone that you like.  if you elect him unanimously, he will come.  and of course he was elected unanimously and he came and before coming he said give me six months to arrange my things and get a little fund so that i can be useful.  i am old but if that is the wish of the ask [the nation] i will comply.

One patient was in Dhour el Choueir, a little boy from a Maronite family, the Samahas. They said; “Oh, our little boy is dying.  Everybody comes and they cannot do anything about it.” Alright, I went there and there was a big palace, a big garden.  People were crowded around and the father was saying: “Sure you brought another doctor; what can he do? What can he do?

You are in intimate contact with people in your capacity as their advisor and friend experiencing their ups and downs. In the profession of the practice of medicine, undoubtedly science and technology are very important but that is not all; with it there is an art of how to reach people in their distress and how to have companionship with and compassion for people.

Beirut,Lebanon,33.89918628,35.48509887,,1935,"        My real patient, who has given me a name among the people as a doctor, was Sheik Yusef Awad; he was the brother of the Bishop of the Maronites. There were two bishops at that time, both of them were very sick.  One was Bishop Adel of the Greek Orthodox Church and the other was the brother of the Maronite priest. Each one was asking about the other, whether he had died or was dying.  Then someone asked me to see the Greek Orthodox Bishop Adel who had congestive heart failure with general anasarca.  At the time we had no potent diuretics so I used tubes and got a complete kerosene can of fluid from his legs and made an infusion of fresh digitalis leaves for his cardiac condition.  Gradually he got better.    There was a lady by the name of Mrs. Ibrahim Aswad who used to visit both bishops.  One day she reported that the Greek Orthodox Bishop was getting better.  Sheik Yusef Awad said: “If Bishop Adel is getting better then why don’t I get better?  Who is looking after him?” Mrs. Aswad replied that an Armenian doctor was; he was a young fellow who had taken charge of medicine at the American University hospital. Sheik Yusef said: “Oh, they don’t have an American doctor?” She said “No, there is this man around there.”


        So one day I see a young boy waiting for me at the hospital gate.  He asked me to go and see his father (father was Sheik Yusef Awad).  I examined his father and found that he was having difficulty breathing and the cause of it was a collection of fluid in the pleural cavity, certainly due to heart failure. I said “you need tapping of the chest to get the fluid out and get the proper dose of digitalis.” I said “ you are a very sick man, but you are not a case that should be left unattended.”


         A very nice girl of eighteen came, beautiful, graceful and I’m a bachelor and I saw tears in her eyes. Her name was Katrine.  I asked her “why are you crying?” The man said “alright” (pointing to another man with eyeglasses who was watching me.  He was a doctor, Sheikh Hannah Khazen was his name. He was a prominent Maronite.) 


“Doctor” he said, “I told them the truth, doctor.  This man is a prominent man and he is going to die and, although he has lots of property he has no cash now and if he dies it is going to cost lots of money to the family.”


I said “alright, what can we do? We have got to try to cure him or at least to relieve him of his symptoms.”


He said “I’ve called all the doctors from the French faculty and from other places and I don’t think there is any fluid in the chest. I don’t [know if?] you can do anything about it.”


        So they gave me a fee, four Lebanese pounds, and sent me home.  Three days later I saw the same boy again asking me to go and see his father. I said that I would be very glad to go as I used to run after patients at that time. I went and again the doctor was over there watching me.  Again the patient would not trust himself to me. 


        The boy came again a third time. He said this time his father wanted the Armenian doctor. The father had said even though he is Armenian, even though he doesn’t know anything he wanted to be treated. He said “bring me the Armenian doctor.”  So I took a potense aspirator ??? and I put the torque-needle into the chest of Sheikh Yusef and Katerine, the daughter, pumped. And the fluid came up and we took, for the first time, about one liter of it and he began to improve.  I had given him digitalis for his heart. They asked me to go and see him regularly and I did go. 
  Sheikh Yusef Awad was married to the sister of Habib Pasha Saad who was the President of the Republic of Lebanon. I was introduced to prominent people even to the Maronite Patriarch and Maronite Bishops. They invited us to their home, Loutfallah Awad at Hasroum and they entertained us, Dr. Alexander Beizjian and me.  By and by I became friends with the family and the fellow told me: “Do you mind taking your honorarium later on when I have money?” I said “certainly, it is alright.” Later on I even gave him a little loan and the man lived and inherited money from his brother who was not married and who had the money to give me back.

","        my real patient, who has given me a name among the people as a doctor, was sheik yusef awad; he was the brother of the bishop of the maronites. there were two bishops at that time, both of them were very sick.  one was bishop adel of the greek orthodox church and the other was the brother of the maronite priest. each one was asking about the other, whether he had died or was dying.  then someone asked me to see the greek orthodox bishop adel who had congestive heart failure with general anasarca.  at the time we had no potent diuretics so i used tubes and got a complete kerosene can of fluid from his legs and made an infusion of fresh digitalis leaves for his cardiac condition.  gradually he got better.    there was a lady by the name of mrs. ibrahim aswad who used to visit both bishops.  one day she reported that the greek orthodox bishop was getting better.  sheik yusef awad said: “if bishop adel is getting better then why don’t i get better?  who is looking after him?” mrs. aswad replied that an armenian doctor was; he was a young fellow who had taken charge of medicine at the american university hospital. sheik yusef said: “oh, they don’t have an american doctor?” she said “no, there is this man around there.”

  sheikh yusef awad was married to the sister of habib pasha saad who was the president of the republic of lebanon. i was introduced to prominent people even to the maronite patriarch and maronite bishops. they invited us to their home, loutfallah awad at hasroum and they entertained us, dr. alexander beizjian and me.  by and by i became friends with the family and the fellow told me: “do you mind taking your honorarium later on when i have money?” i said “certainly, it is alright.” later on i even gave him a little loan and the man lived and inherited money from his brother who was not married and who had the money to give me back.

I said “what can I do if she is dying?” But they would not leave me alone, so I had to put on my work clothes and go to attend to the patient.  There I entered a fine home, finely furnished, and saw a very beautiful woman sleeping in a fine night dress in beautiful sheets in the bed. And she keeps on repeating “Je meure, je meure.” I examined her and found the pulse is alright, the blood pressure is alright, abdomen examination is alright, temperature is not high, her lungs are clear and her heart sounds good. I replied: “C’est dommage vous allez mourir, mais pas maintenent madame.”[It is unfortunate that you will die, but not now madam.] These words immediately produced a different atmosphere in the home.  Later on I found out that she had been in the clinic of a doctor who had diagnosed her affliction as an appendix which might burst.  However, there was no evidence of bursting of anything.  So all these high-class people took me into a room and offered me a drink.  There were several kinds of drinks on the table.  They asked me what I wanted.  I said that I did not know these things, so I asked them to please give me the best.  The difficulty with her was she was afraid that her appendix had burst.

        But I must mention my good friend Dr. Najeeb Ardati, who was a Moslem,  a man who had faith in God and did things in a right way whenever he could.  When he became sick, he made me his own doctor physician, he died rather young.  The greatest thing I have done in my life I owe it to him.


        In 1936 I was seated in my front garden and thinking what a big fool I was that when there was a chance to immigrate I stayed here because the same story of the Moslems and Christians had erupted in Beirut. And the Moslems had attacked the Armenians /and did insult and/ the Maronite families with whom I was in close contact, they asked me what am I doing in this situation.   I was not aware that there was anything happening because I was busy with my work. Then a neighbor and a friend of ours came to our home. He said, Doctor what are you doing about the situation? What can I do, Oh he said you can do a great deal, you have many friends. And I thought of Dr. Najeeb Ardati, and went and talked to him, he said now that you are talking very sincerely with me, I will answer you sincerely. One of your deputies has said that the Armenians are going to be on the French side to stay in this country [help the French stay in Lebanon]. In fact they had said they have ten thousand guns. Ha, I said, the French mandate is to stay in Beirut; can they depend on Armenians? If they want to leave the country what have the Armenians got to do with it?  In fact, I said, we are grateful to the hospitable Arab countries, Arab people, who have received us and given us a means for our livelihood.  Then he said, if you are willing to get a representative group from the Armenians I will take you to the house of Abu Ali Salam, and you talk to them (the man who is prominent in the country now is Said Salam he has become prime minister so many time). And we did go there having eighteen full cars and there were the Moslems all together.  There I talked to them that we are grateful, we have nothing but gratitude to the native Arab Moslem, we suffered a great deal from Moslems but they were Turks, Turks who attached us.  In fact our supreme religious leader has told us do not be at all in the hands of others. They were convinced of my sincerity and that afternoon they came to visit the church and they shook hands and the animosity stopped.

Beirut,Lebanon,33.89386344,35.54044959,May,1936," But the most significant thing that I have done was in 1936 . One day in May there was an outburst of animosity and attack on Armenians from the Moslem quarters.  At that time there was a great movement to have the French leave Syria and Lebanon.  And some Armenians were suspected of having sided with the French against the Moslem population of the country.  This was absolutely without foundation, it was an empty boasting of some a person who was really not Armenian; he was married to an Armenian and wanted to make himself sound important (check the tape).  I have talked before about my friend Dr. Najeeb Ardati.  I told him that if the French are going to stay in the country it is not the Armenians that are going to keep them here. Or, if they are going to be put out of the country, it is not the Armenians that are going to do that.  Whatever the Lebanese do, the Armenians are with them.  The Armenians have nothing against the population of Syria or Lebanon in fact we are grateful to them.  It so happened that I had come on that day from a visit to our old Catholicos, Sahag, who had told us “you better not be the tongs in the hands of other people to draw their chestnuts from the fire; if they want to, let them burn their own fingers.” When Dr. Ardati, who is a very prominent Moslem, saw that I was very sincere he told me that if you are willing to prove this to the higher Moslem committee, I will arrange for a higher meeting [with them]. So we went to the house of the president of the Moslem higher committee.  This gentleman’s name was Abu Ali Al Salam, the father of the well known Saib Salam, [many times prime minister of Lebanon]. The most prominent Moslems were there gathered together and we were a group of about 40 people from different groups of Armenians.  When they found out that we had no animosity, no quarrel, no support for the French....? That afternoon they stopped the attack [on the Armenians] and the Mufti came to greet our bishop and as it was the month of Ramadan, a period of fasting, we prepared a table for all that group in our home [for the evening after sundown meal].  And this good wife of mine entertained them and we shook hands and that was the end of that episode.  As we have learned not to depend on foreigners, or anybody outside Lebanon, to protect us against our neighbor, during this cruel and atrocious conflict of 1975-76 Armenians have acted very wisely [by not taking sides and by staying neutral] and were spared.

        In 1926, I was called to see Ameer Murad Abu Lama’h at Jedaidah.  He lived in a palatial house with a big hall and had a beautiful wife; she was tall, erect and graceful.  The big hall was full of people and there was a French doctor with a beard, he was a professor of medicine called Calmet. He said: “My friend, he has double pneumonia and he has diabetes, he is doomed.” I examined the patient, he was suffering from  pneumonia no doubt.  At that time we had to wait for the pneumonia to resolve, it took its course. We had no medicine that really affected pneumonia. 


I said, “now, recently there is insulin.” 
Calmet replied: “Oh, insulin is a very dangerous medicine.”
“Yes” I said, “it might produce an untold effect if you do not know how to use it.”
Calmet said “alright, go ahead, you are young.  I turn the patient over to you.”

    I asked the family to employ two nurses, one for the night and one for the day.  I gave them the necessary equipment to examine his urine every time he passed it. Every time we found glucose in his urine we gave him a dose of insulin.  I visited the patient daily, morning and evening and he soon made a  recovery.  I collected from them all my fees, 10 gold pounds, and with that I bought my first bath tub.","

        First I started in my profession and I served everyone that came to me with the best that is in me; and the best in me is to encourage people and make them feel good after they have come to my clinic. In fact, lots of people came to me with diseases which were psychosomatic and they had a sense of guilt of some kind.  There is a calligraphic writing framed and hanging in my office; it is a verse from the Korean where he [Mohamad] said: “Go tell those that believe in me that I am a forgiving and merciful God.” [nabi’ Ibadi ini ana al-ghfour al rahim]


        Then I realized that there are two great calamities in this life; the first is disease, the second is poverty.  And if these are combined in one person, now that person must be helped.  In the nineteen twenties and thirties there was a great deal of tuberculosis in the country, maybe more among the Armenian poor and refugee population.


        And we had two or three sanatoria in the country [Lebanon] but they were full and there was no more room.  One day I was called to the Armenian camps to see a school teacher who was having hemorrhage from his lungs.  That made me work very hard to build a sanatorium in the mountains of Lebanon in [a village called] called Azounieh.  Now I was a distinguished beggar. So I tried to raise funds and build a sanatorium of about 100 beds.  For this, I have worked from 1929 up to 1940 as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and I have written many many letters to my friends asking for contributions.  I am glad now that tuberculosis is not as prevalent, but there are other diseases that the sanatorium is used for to serve the villagers around Azounieh.  It is also used as a refuge for the old and the destitute.  This is not confined to Armenians; Azounieh serves all Lebanon and the Arab countries.

You may know about the book by F. Werfel, the 40 days of Musa Dagh. The group that was evacuated from their mountain hiding places or mountain fortresses, they came to Lebanon and were established in Ainjar, just half-way between Beirut and Damascus (some also settled near Tyre (was it Sidon??). There was a great deal of infant mortality, dysentary, malaria, tuberculosis among them.

There were the Armenians who resisted in their mountains for forty days against the Turkish army and against the massacre of the Turks; then they were picked up with a French steamboat and were taken to port Said in Egypt. They came back to their villages after the first world war was over and they cultivated their land and they were prosperous. But our friends the French, to keep the Turks out of the second world war gave us to them as a bribe, the French gave the Turks the whole of Mousa Dagh.  That is the only thing they would agree on.
