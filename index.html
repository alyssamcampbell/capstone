            <b><u>About this project:</b></u> This project is an interactive data visualization narrative of the oral history of my great-grandfather, Hovsep Aghek Yeni-Komshian (Hovsep), born April 2, 1895 to an Armenian family in Kilis, Cilicia, Ottoman Empire.
            Before World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, millions of Armenians lived throughout what is today Eastern Turkey, their nearly 3000-year history in the region making them one of the oldest indigenous groups of the area. However, today the Armenian presence in Anatolia has largely been erased due to the Armenian Genocide (1915-1923), during which nearly the entire local Armenian population was murdered or forcibly deported by Turkish officials, with a death toll of more than one million. Those who did manage to survive became the Armenian Diaspora, escaping to Syria, Lebanon, and beyond.
            After fleeing Kilis, Hovsep spent the majority of his adult life in Beirut, Lebanon, where he met his wife Helen, raised five children, and practiced medicine for more than four decades until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), which forced him to relocate, once again, to the United States at the age of 84. Between 1973 and 1983, Hovsep, with the support of his daughters, recorded an account of his life resulting in more than 50 pages of transcribed oral history.
            This project explores Hovsep's life through his learnings, loves and losses. In the first part, data visualization and analysis with the support of Python's NLTK library are used to illustrate the main themes and sentiments of Hovsep's life. In the second part, an abridged version of Hovsep's oral history is presented through a visual narrative, in his own words, accompanied by photos from family albums and recent travels to Lebanon and Eastern Turkey.

            <p style="font-size: 0.5em; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%">
            To analyze Hovsep's thoughts and emotions by time and place, the oral history transcript was converted into a tabular data set with each thought associated with a time and place. This was then analyzed in Python using the NRCLexicon library for emotion classification, which predicts the sentiments and emotion of a given text based on a library of 27,000 words. The resultant sentiment score represents the 'intensity' or 'frequency' of an emotion in the text, with a polarity scale of 0-1. For example, if a text contains many words associated with 'joy', its joy score will be higher. For overall sentiment, the average between positive and negative sentiment was calculated for each year, with a higher score indicating more positive sentiment.              
            </p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.5em; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%; column-count: 2;">
        The stacked area chart on the left shows both the predominant emotions detected from Hovsep's oral history overall, and how those changed throughout his life. For example, trust, anticipation, and joy had the strongest intensity in their scores, whereas emotions like anger and disgust remained relatively low throughout Hovsep's life. 
        The categorical heat map on the right visualizes how Hovsep's felt about each of the countries where he spent significant time. The intensity of the scores overall is low, so the visualization creates a relative comparison of the intensity of emotion for each country, with brighter colors signifying a stronger score for that emotion compared to the other countries on the list. For example, there is the highest anger and fear associated with Turkey relative to other countries. Trust was relatively higher for Syria, where Hovsep's family initially fled to for safety in Aleppo.  </p>

                                By 1923 it was quite clear that there was no more hope for the Armenians to go back to their homes in Turkey. My father, mother and younger brothers came to see me in Beirut. 
    <br><br>We rented a small house on Rue Jeanne D'Arc, in the middle of mulberry groves.  My father decided to move the family to Beirut.  He returned to Aleppo and sent for the other members of the family to come to Beirut by rail.  He accompanied the horse (who saved the family from deportation) to Alexandretta, which was part of Syria at that time. They both arrived in Beirut by sea.
    <br><br>By this time, we had moved to a larger house on Rue Bliss which also had a garden and a small stable. And one of the gratifications that I have in life is that my father and mother finished their days under their own roof.

                                    I had my own difficulties, but I was looking around 1925-1926 <span class = "highlight">for a companion in life</span>, but years would go by and nothing would come that would in any way click. Certainly, I had made a few attempts, some of them almost to the conclusion, but it was not quite the right thing until one day in February of 1929.
    <br><br>
    I was called to see an Armenian patient from Aintab who was a friend of my father, and had come from London with his family en route to Aleppo. He needed care, he was gravely ill. When I entered the room, beside the sick man there was a beautiful woman with curly hair coming down to her dress, she was the daughter. 
    
    <br><br>When I saw Helen for the first time, <span class = "highlight">Ah! Ah! My heart jumped;</span> she was the person I was looking for years and years.<br><br> 
                                   
                              
    Although I had been searching for a wife for 5-6 years, it did not take more than six days to be engaged to Helen. At the time of our engagement, Helen and I pledged to each other that we would face the music together and we promised to face whatever life had in store for us through thick and thin.
    <br><br> We were married on February 23, 1930 in Saint Nishan Church, Beirut. Thank God we have had a full life together and were blessed with five healthy children. Our married life has been based on mutual understanding, mutual trust, mutual confidence and mutual sharing.

                                    <p><span class="highlight-2">From my earliest childhood, I wanted to become a physician</span>. I was granted a life of study and teaching. I started as a Professor of Medicine at the AUB Department for Internal Medicine – where I spent 42 years, alongside visiting professorships in New Orleans and London.
    <br><br>
    <span class="highlight-2">My relation with my students have been a great satisfaction in my life.</span> At first they are raw material, some of them seem to know almost everything that is known in medicine, but gradually, they realize that there are lots of problems in medicine even their teacher does not know.  So I have never looked on any of my students as someone in anyway inferior to me. A number of students, who have come in contact with me now, they are specialists and they call me “maalmi,” my teacher.  It is really a joy to meet them, to talk to them and feel that you have had a part in their growth.
    <br><br>
    Now I believe there are things in being a physician that brings a man close to his fellow man more than any other profession. Science and technology are very important but that is not all; with it there is an art of how to reach people in their distress and how to have compassion for people. I feel that <span class="highlight-2">mind and body are complementary; they are not two distinct things.</span> As a physician you have got to take into your consideration the personality of the patient and give your treatment accordingly.
   <br><br> The Armenian population in Lebanon expanded when survivors of the Armenian Genocide arrived in the 1915 aftermath. They lived in makeshift camps by the Beirut River, enduring squalid conditions without proper sanitation, water, or electricity. Disease was rampant, especially tuberculosis. [But] the existing sanitoriums in Lebanon were full and couldn’t take any more patients. This experience ignited my determination to establish the Armenian National Sanatorium in Azounieh for tuberculosis patients. While tuberculosis is now less prevalent, the sanatorium serves various purposes, including care for the elderly and destitute, benefiting not just Armenians but all of Lebanon and surrounding Arab countries.
